# hand-made-MLP

This notebook shows how a multi-layer perceptron is made.
The forward & backward propagation, gradient descent, momentum, training using batch gradiant and epochs are all hand-made, not using pytorch or tensorflow.

This work was done as part of the course at IMT (Institut Mines Telecom) on AI.
